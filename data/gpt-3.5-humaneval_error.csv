        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.

    Example 2:
        Input: [1,2,3]
        Output: [2, 1]
        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.

    Example 4:

        Explanation: 0 is the smallest value, but  there are two zeros,
